## What is Nginx

Nginx is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, Nginx can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.

Nginx can be used as a load balancer. Load balancing across multiple application instances is a commonly used technique for optimizing resource utilization, maximizing throughput, reducing latency, and ensuring faultâ€‘tolerant configurations. The figure above shows an example of how a load balancer distributes client requests to 3 app servers.



## Prepare an Nginx Config File

Nginx uses a configuration file called `nginx.cfg` to configure its functions. If we want to use it as a load balancer, here is the [documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/http-load-balancer/) how to install and configure Nginx using Ansible. Here is a sample snippet of `nginx.cfg` to use it as a load balancer.

```
upstream backend {
    server 1.2.3.4:5000; # backend service 1
    server 1.2.3.4:6000; # backend service 2
}

server {
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend; # forward all requests to backend upstream
    }
}

```

## Install and Configure Nginx

Instead of installing Nginx as an additional container using Docker Compose, we install Nginx on `localhost`, which means the Codespaces instance we are using. Here is an sample Play that installs Nginx. Note the line `hosts: localhost`. Here is an [article](https://cumioyemike.medium.com/build-and-deploy-an-nginx-load-balancing-infrastructure-using-ansible-and-vagrant-6fe8f570abd9) how to use Ansible to install and configure Nginx. The key tasks of the play we need is shown below.

```yaml
- name: Play - Install and configure Nginx as a LoadBalancer
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update cache
      apt: update_cache=yes   
    - name: Install Nginx
      # TODO
    - name: Copy the Nginx config file to /etc/nginx/sites-available
      # TODO
      become: yes
    - name: Create symlink of the config file at /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
      # TODO
    - name: Restart nginx to apply changes
      # TODO
```

## Test the LoadBalancer

First, check if Nginx is installed and running.
```bash
$ service nginx status
 * nginx is running
```
Then check if Nginx config file is present.
```bash
$ ls -l /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 36 Mar 12 06:45 default -> /etc/nginx/sites-available/nginx.cfg
```

Last, check if the load balancer is working as expected. Visit http://0.0.0.0. The returned text will be from the backend services. We should see that the backend services will take turns to serve each request.
```bash
$ curl http://0.0.0.0
Hello World from managedhost-app-1
$ curl http://0.0.0.0
Hello World from managedhost-app-2
$ curl http://0.0.0.0
Hello World from managedhost-app-3
$ curl http://0.0.0.0
Hello World from managedhost-app-1 
$ curl http://0.0.0.0
Hello World from managedhost-app-2
$ curl http://0.0.0.0
Hello World from managedhost-app-3
...
```

## Reinstalling Nginx

If there are errors when you install and configure Nginx, use the following Play to completely uninstall Nginx before you retry installing and configuring it.

```yaml
# Uninstall Nginx
- name: Play - Uninstall Nginx
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  tasks: 
    - name: Unnstall Nginx
      apt: name=nginx state=absent
```
Then, run the following command to purge all Nginx configs:
```bash
$ sudo apt purge nginx nginx-common nginx-full
```

## Ansible Python API

For the Python API, we should use the Python `ansible-runner` library.

## References

* [Using Runner as a Python Module Interface to Ansible](https://ansible-runner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_interface.html)

## Python Library Installation

```bash
$ pip install ansible-runner
```
Your code should import `ansible_runner` library.

```python
#Load_Inventory.py
import ansible_runner
import yaml

def load_inventory_and_ping():
    # Define the path to the inventory file
    inventory_path = 'hosts.yml'

    # Load inventory
    r = ansible_runner.run(private_data_dir='.', inventory=inventory_path, playbook='hello.yml')

    # Load the inventory YAML file
    with open(inventory_path, 'r') as file:
        inventory = yaml.safe_load(file)

    # Extract group information
    host_to_group = {}
    for group, hosts in inventory.items():
        if group == 'all':
            continue
        for host in hosts['hosts']:
            host_to_group[host] = group

    # Print names, IP addresses, and group names of all hosts
    for event in r.events:
        if event['event'] == 'runner_on_ok':
            host = event['event_data']['host']
            group = host_to_group.get(host, 'Unknown')
            print(f"Name: {host}, IP: {event['stdout']}, Group: {group}")

    # Output ping results
    print("\nPing Results:")
    for event in r.events:
        if event['event'] == 'runner_on_ok':
            host = event['event_data']['host']
            if 'stdout_lines' in event:
                print(f"{host}: {event['stdout_lines']}")
            else:
                print(f"{host}: No output available")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    load_inventory_and_ping()

#Run_Playbook.py
import subprocess

def run_playbook(playbook_path):
    cmd = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path, '-i', './hosts.yml']
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout, result.stderr

if __name__ == "__main__":
    playbook_path = 'hello.yml'
    stdout, stderr = run_playbook(playbook_path)
    print("Playbook Output:")
    print(stdout)
    print("Errors if any:")
    print(stderr)

```
